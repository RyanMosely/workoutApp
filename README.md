## Conclusion

I found that the use of mongoose can be ran in a pretty clean fashion; I like the fact that you potentially use the same routing methods and have identical models as you would with sequelize, so changing databases can be pretty painless. Outside of mongoose, I love the CLI that can be used with mongo; it feels pretty straight forward in terms of creating collections.
I can see how useful mongodb/mongoose can be and am looking forward to implementing it in my future projects.
